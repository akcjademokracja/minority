# Minority

Minority is a gem adding extra functionalities to Identity.
They could hopefully become mainstream one day. Before this happens, though, they stay here.


## Installation

Add to your Gemfile

```
group :minority do
  gem 'minority', git: "https://github.com/akcjademokracja/minority", branch: "master"
end
```

## Development

If you want to work on identity, you can set bundler to use the gem checked out under local path:

`bundle config local.minority /home/marcin/Projects/minority/ ` 

## Contributing
